<p3>* I chose to use the term “Galiza” instead of “Galicia” as an act of resistance. Etymologically speaking, they’re both correct and accepted, but Galiza –as Castelao, Viqueira and the Brotherhoods wrote– is the genuine form of the name of the country in our language, Galicia is a Castilianism. Its usage is not just a linguistic and historical question, but a political one. 
<br/>* The Pact of Forgetting or Pacto del Olvido, was an unwritten agreement in Spain following the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975, in which Spanish society decided not to dwell on the crimes and human rights abuses committed during Franco’s regime and instead focus on rebuilding the country and moving forward. The pact allowed for a transition to democracy without retribution or accountability for those who committed atrocities during Franco’s rule. Effectively creating a taboo around the country’s recent past.
<br/> * Social and moral decay is understood as the fall of a society; characterized by a rise of violence, the loss of cultural identity, economic difficulties and the downfall of government.

 <p5> The process of decay is a universal phenomenon that affects every living thing, from the smallest microbe to the largest organism. It is an inescapable part of the natural cycle of life. As humans, we are closely familiar with this process, as we witness it not only in our own lives but also in the world around us. Decay can take many forms, from the crumbling of buildings and the erosion of landscapes to the decline of social and moral values.<br/> Through a mix of factual and fictional writing, this thesis aims to shed some light on the nuances of the process. Starting off by examining the specific form of social decay that occurs in war zones, I will be using the Spanish Civil War and its impact on the Galician territory as my point of departure. Further, I will delve into the ways in which war caused the fragmentation of collective memory, the erasure of linguistic heritage and how we can consider <p3>Galiza*</p3> as a post-colonial territory. 
 <br/>Additionally, I will be exploring how decay relates to material and infrastructural contexts. By examining how <p3>The Pact of Forgetting*</p3> contributed to the emergence of places of denial and perpetuation. As well as considering how maintenance could be employed as a tool for resistance against this process.
 <br/>In the last section of my thesis, I aim to take an embodied, fictional perspective, exploring what it means for a language and an infrastructure to perish, and how various aspects of decay can be experienced from their viewpoint. To do this, I will draw on theories such as Object-Oriented Ontology which can offer a unique lens through which to view the world.

<p> In 2023, one could easily state that we live in upsetting times and are constantly dealing with the consequences and hardships of our busy existence. From ecological disasters to manmade atrocities, it seems that everything we are surrounded with has an expiring date, and we are constantly faced with various levels of degradation.</p>    
<p> Being a process, decay has a temporality, a pace or a tempo, and a spatiality, a mode of occupying and evolving in a space. <p2>(Ghassan Hager, pp.13)</p2> Things decay in quite diverse ways, and it would be absurd to assume otherwise or to ignore the particulars behind it. But as decay seems to float between abstract and objective implications, it is only normal to wonder; what do we mean when we talk about being in a period of <p3>social and moral decay*?</p3> How can we measure or recognise it as such? Or in a more tangible connotation, what are we talking about when we refer to bodily, material, or infrastructural decay? Such questions would be explored and argued within these pages, as it requires some reflection, given that most people of the world take it for granted that decay is the normal order of things. <p2>(ibid)</p2></p>
<p> As previously mentioned, there are several stages in which decay can be found. But we often understand decay from an organic point of view, which includes two processes of importance: Endo-decay, where decomposition comes from the inside-out and Exo-decay, where it is caused by external environmental forces. This differentiation between Endo-decay and Exo-decay is hardly ever neat, and the two processes can often be entangled in the making and unmaking of social processes. <p2>(ibid)</p2> Such statement opens a window to consider the wider aspects and relations that it carries, from a material and infrastructural process of degradation to a condition for social and moral decline. </p>
<p>Hence, from a material and infrastructural point of view, it would be smart to also consider the tempo and the agency in which things decay. As mentioned by Ghassan Hager in his book Decay: “Decomposition and disintegration are no longer happening imperceptibly, where, and how they should.” This raises questions about the temporality, functionality, and the development of the environments in which decay can thrive. As well as the speed at which we create, relate, and consume matter. We will also dive into the importance of maintenance work and human agency in the face of decay. Touching upon notions of preservation through archaeology and technology. Furthermore, if we focus on the social and moral aspects of decay, we can pinpoint war as one of the major contributors of such demeaning. As it often involves the use of violence and aggression, the destruction of infrastructure and property –– precisely targeted at the destruction of cultural heritage –– moral decay, and ultimately the loss of lives. These things can all contribute to a decline in values and standards and can lead to a breakdown of social and political order. Moreover, they contribute to the loss of collective memory and to the damage or partial loss of culture. </p>
<p>A clear example of such collective loss can be seen in culturally diverse countries that underwent large war periods, such as Spain. More specifically in Galiza, where the impact of the 40-year dictatorship under Franco’s ruling was, and still is of importance. It contributed to the erasure and damage of the culture and language of the Galizan territory, something that still has an enormous repercussion in our contemporary society. Such is the repercussion today that, three generations later, Galizans like me, are barely acquaintance with the language nor the story of their own region. Therefore, I write this text out of the urgency for the restoration of Galiza’s collective memory, and the desire for the survival of its language. On the other hand, I also write from the perspective of someone that holds the tools and responsibility for visual communication and can thus, play a role in the mitigation of such decay.</p>
<p> In order to gain a more nuanced and understanding idea of decay, it is important to comprehend it as a multiscalar and multifaceted process. It is not always simple or straightforward, and the several factors that contribute to decay can interact and influence each other in complex ways. Recognizing that decay can have both negative and positive aspects can help us approach it more objectively and to find ways to address and mitigate its negative impacts while also taking advantage of its potential for growth and renewal.

<p4>1.1.	On Galiza’s decay</p4>
<p>As previously mentioned, social decay can be understood and explored within the context of war-torn territories. Using Galiza as a case study, I will illustrate the ways in which the oppression experienced during the Civil War contributed to the erosion of a language, and how this had a direct impact on the preservation of the Galizan culture. 
Starting in the summer of 1936 with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, there were thousands of acts of oppression between the Republicans and the Nationalists. During the three years of the war, it is estimated that the Francoists murdered approximately 5000 political dissidents, while silencing most of the living witnesses and destroying most of the written testimonies. <p2>(Thompson, John. 2014)</p2> Anyone with liberal ideas contrary to the national movement –– even in places where there had never been a war front –– like Galiza, were faced with executions. It is most likely because of this factor, that Galiza has remained until recently relatively invisible within the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>In the case of Galiza, the region immediately fell under Francisco Franco’s totalitarian regime, and even though the fascist repression was extremely disproportionate in comparison to other areas of Spain, not much armed opposition was encountered. This brutal repression is important to understand the politics of forgetting in present Galiza. Both migrations and centralism within the territory created an image of a colonial subject under the regime that was rapidly assimilated by Galizans. <p2>(Gonzalez-Ruibal, Alfredo. 2005)</p2></p>
<p>In order to be able to understand the oppression of the Galizan territory from a possible colonial perspective, it's important to note that Spain treated Galiza as a marginal periphery deserving limited space in the configuration of the Spanish kingdom and identity, and therefore Galiza could be considered and analyzed in comparison with other countries under colonial regimes. <p2>(Rei-Doval, Gabriel 2016)</p2> While it was not a colony in the traditional sense –– as it was not a territory controlled by a foreign power –– it was, however, treated as one by the regime. As mentioned by professor Xosé Manuel Beiras in his book Galiza’s economic backwardness: “Galiza had historically been and still is an “internal colony”. The continuous struggle for power, recognition and preservation of its culture and identity can be seen as a way for its people to assert their identity and challenge the dominance of the dominant group. Franco’s fascist dictatorship conveyed not only a political but also a linguistic and cultural repression. Specific economic and cultural factors –– such as a particular intense urbanization process and the imposition of Spanish as the dominant language in school –– contributed to the shift in informal usage of the Galizan language.
