        <h3> Abstract</h3>
<p> The process of decay is a universal phenomenon that affects every living thing, from the smallest microbe to the largest organism. It is an inescapable part of the natural cycle of birth, growth, and death. As humans, we are closely familiar with this process, as we witness it not only in our own lives but also in the world around us. Decay can take many forms, from the crumbling of buildings and the erosion of landscapes to the decline of social and moral values. </p>
<p>Through a mix of factual and fictional writing, this thesis aims to shed some light on the nuances of the process. Starting off by examining the specific form of social decay that occurs in war zones, I will be using the Spanish Civil War and its impact on the Galician territory as my point of departure. Further, I will delve into the ways in which war caused the fragmentation of collective memory, the erasure of linguistic heritage and how we can consider Galicia as a post-colonial territory. 
Additionally, I will be exploring how decay relates to material and infrastructural contexts, by specifically examining how the transformation of sites of violence has led to the emergence of places of denial and perpetuation. As well as considering how maintenance can be employed as a tool for resistance against this process.
In the last section of my thesis, I aim to take an embodied, fictional perspective, exploring what it means for a language and an infrastructure to perish, and how various aspects of decay can be experienced from their viewpoint. To do this, I will draw on theories such as Object-Oriented Ontology which can offer a unique lens through which to view the world.
</p>

        <h3> Introduction </h3>
<p> In 2023, one could easily state that we live in upsetting times and are constantly dealing with the consequences and hardships of our busy existence. From ecological disasters to manmade atrocities, it seems that everything we are surrounded with has an expiring date, and we are constantly faced with various levels of degradation.</p>    
<p> Being a process, decay has a temporality, a pace or a tempo, and a spatiality, a mode of occupying and evolving in a space. (Ghassan Hager, pp.13) Things decay in quite diverse ways, and it would be absurd to assume otherwise or to ignore the particulars behind it. But as decay seems to float between abstract and objective implications, it is only normal to wonder; what do we mean when we talk about being in a period of social and moral decay? How can we measure or recognise it as such? Or in a more tangible connotation, what are we talking about when we refer to bodily, material, or infrastructural decay? Such questions would be explored and argued within these pages, as it requires some reflection, given that most people of the world take it for granted that decay is the normal order of things. (Ghassan Hager, pp.11)</p>
<p> As previously mentioned, there are several stages in which decay can be found. But we often understand decay from an organic point of view, which includes two processes of importance: Endo-decay, where decomposition comes from the inside-out and Exo-decay, where it is caused by external environmental forces. This differentiation between Endo-decay and Exo-decay is hardly ever neat, and the two processes can often be entangled in the making and unmaking of social processes. (Ghassan Hager, pp.18) Such statement opens a window to consider the wider aspects and relations that it carries, from a material and infrastructural process of degradation to a condition for social and 
moral decline. </p>
<p> Hence, from a material and infrastructural standpoint of view, it would be smart to also consider the tempo and the agency in which things decay. As mentioned by Ghassan Hager in his book Decay: “Decomposition and disintegration are no longer happening imperceptibly, where, and how they should.” This raises questions about the temporality, functionality, and the development of the environments in which decay can thrive. As well as the speed in which we create, relate, and consume matter. We will also dive into the importance of maintenance work and human agency in the face of decay.Touching upon notions of preservation through archaeology and technology. </p>
<p> Furthermore, if we focus on the social and moral aspects of decay, we can pinpoint war as one of the major contributors of such demeaning. As it often involves the use of violence and aggression, the precisely targetted destruction of cultural heritage, moral decay and ultimately the loss of lives. These things can all contribute to a decline in values and standards and can lead to a breakdown of social and political order. Moreover, they contribute to the loss of collective memory and to the damage or partial loss of culture.  </p>
<p> A clear example of such collective loss can be seen in culturally diverse countries that underwent large war periods, such as Spain for example. More specifically in Galicia, where the impact of the 40-year dictatorship of Franco was, and still is of importance. It contributed to the erasure and damage of the culture and language of the Galician territory, something that still has an enormous repercusion in our contemporary society, and I would be talking about in more depth in the upcoming chapter.
However, to gain a more nuanced and complete understanding of decay, it is important to comprehend it as a multiscalar and multifaceted process. It is not always simple or straightforward, and the several factors that contribute to decay can interact and influence each other in complex ways. Recognizing that decay can have both negative and positive aspects can help us approach it more objectively and to find ways to address and mitigate its negative impacts while also taking advantage of its potential for growth and renewal.</p>
        
<h3>Out of tempo</h3>
        
<p1>I realised there was a part of the recent history of my country (Spain) more specifically of Galicia, that I had not been told at home, at school, nor on the street. It is something that is not talked about enough. As if not mentioning it would mean it never happened. With “out of tempo” I aim to speak of silence and the untold stories that emerge from oppression. This would be a walk through the forgotten, the decayed, the effects of purposely silencing parts of a culture. Of the negligence towards the past, and thus, towards the future.</p1>
<p>On the Galician territory</p>
<p>Social decay can be understood and explored within the context of war-torn territories, using Galicia as a case study I will illustrate the ways in which the oppression experienced during the war contributed to the erosion of a language, and how this had a direct impact on the preservation of the Galician culture. 
Galician is a minority language spoken in the north-western area of Spain, it is amongst the myriad of minority languages in Europe, holding a distinguished position as one of only three official languages of the Spanish region. The story of the Galician language is one of resistance, as it has been fighting for its position as an official language since the Middle Ages. Back then, the idea of the Galician language being at risk, was more of a potential threat rather than a practical concern, but with the development of urban and academic areas, came the concern for such loss.  Revitalization efforts only started in the 19th century as part of the process that Galician historiography has called Rexurdimento (“revival”) of its language and culture. (Gabriel Rei-Doval.2016) This resistance efforts were triggered by the oppression suffered under the regime and constituted a pivotal moment in the preservation and promotion of Galician culture. Making it visible not only within the spoken scope, but also as a formal written language.  
</p>
<p>Starting in the summer of 1936 with the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, there were thousands of acts of oppression between the Republicans and the Nationalists. Anyone with liberal ideas contrary to the national movement – even in places where there had never been a war front – were faced with executions. 
In the case of Galicia, it immediately fell under the totalitarian regime, and no armed opposition was encountered. Even though, the fascist repression was extremely disproportionate and caused the torture and death of several thousand people: workers, peasants, politicians, lawyers, intellectuals, teachers etc. This brutal repression is important to understand the politics of forgetting in present Galicia. Both migrations and centralism created an image of a colonial subject that was rapidly assimilated by Galicians. (Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal.2005) 
In order to be able to understand the oppression of the Galician territory from a colonial perspective, it's important to note that Spain, treated Galicia as a marginal periphery deserving limited space in the configuration of the Spanish kingdom and identity, and therefore Galicia could be considered and analysed by comparison with other African and Asian countries. (Gabriel Rei-Doval.2016) While Galicia was not a colony in the traditional sense – as it was not a territory controlled by a foreign power – it was, however, treated as one by the regime. 
</p>
        <p>On Gallego as resistance</p>
<p>The Galician language conflict is a centuries-long competition between a dominant (Castilian-Spanish) and non-dominant (Galician) language. The destruction during, and oppression after the Spanish Civil War reversed decades of Galician cultural progress. (Language Conflict Encyclopaedia) As a response to the oppressive “unification of Spain”, minority groups formed (mostly) by intellectuals performed acts of resistance that emerged with the goal of overcoming diglossia*. Promoting the use of Galician as a cultural heritage worthy of preservation as either a unique manifestation of an original culture or as the most recognizable symbol of a differentiated collective identity. However, such acts of resistance were done “illegally” and most of the times, from abroad, as many Galicians were forced to migrate to either, other parts of Spain or to other countries in search of better economic opportunities. Something that also contributed to the future demeaning of the language within the private sphere in the Galician territory. 
The percentage of monolingual Galician speakers has decreased, in part favoured by the easy transition from Spanish and also by the fact that the urbanization process in Galicia has led to the disappearance of the cultural references and habits that had favoured the continued use of Galician in rural areas over the centuries. (Gabriel Rei-Doval.2016) Something that contributed even more to the decay on the language was its value, as Galicia lacked a middle class speaking the language, the use of Spanish was directly linked with prestige. 
The school system, the media and the economy related to the tertiary sector (industry, services etc) have historically functioned on the language of the dominant nation-state. As a result, this has helped to shape language behaviour and practices, promoting the usage of Spanish in these settings. (Gabriel Rei-Doval.2016) 
</p>
<p> Today, the Galician language is diminished and endangered by the region’s dependence on the Spanish state, and a large monolingual Castilian population living in Galician cities, many of whose identity is now equal parts Spanish and Galician. This conflict, centres on the struggle for the revival and maintenance of a language that, over the centuries, had suffered decay in a rural region with 
high outmigration.

<h3>Out of place</h3> 
<p1>Psychogeography: the practice of exploring the urban environment while being led by curiosity and a paused sense of time and place. While it is important to let your senses absorb the spaces around you, it is equally, if not more important to find yourself in new spaces, spaces stumbled upon by chance; paying attention to the smaller details, the lost objects, the signage, the fragments that make walking a reward in itself, with a slower pace and an increased opportunity to revel in the simple pleasures of things. A sense of wander/wonder is essential to find the simplicity in urban living. </p1>
<p>On material decay as perpetuation<p></p>
<p>After the Spanish Civil War in 1977, in an effort to find peace and allow a fresh start for a democracy, the Spanish government put in place an amnesty law called “the pact of forgetting”. As an attempt to move on from the war, and focus on the future of Spain, the government committed itself to “disremembering”, like this, failing to hold accountable those who contributed to the many atrocities done under the name of the regime. 
Within this chapter, we will be focusing on how such law contributed to the perpetuation of violence within decaying spaces and infrastructures in the Galician territory. We will be diving into the repercussion of such law on the Galician collective memory, and we will also explore human agency and aspects of maintenance, in relation to material decay and preservation.

<h3>Before my very eyes</h3> 
<p>I was of the land, and of you. Travelling through air, and ears. You made me, and so you think you can dispose me? I see myself forced to move, to unroot myself. How can I be, if I aint of you? You breathe me in, and out. You sometimes talk me low, and loud.</p>
<p>The possibilities were endless. But I didn’t know where to go. Enter.Enter. Enter. I kept typing but I couldn’t figure it out. There is beauty in the uncertainty of searching.I’ve never thought of myself as good at something specific, but maybe I am good at getting lost. And I guess that’s okay.I always thought the search would adjust to me, that it would give me answers. That it would predict what I need; Am I depressed? Am I a narcissist? Am I pregnant?But at last, all I wanted to know wasn’t there. Am I so difficult to understand? I often wonder if looking at you so regularly makes me more sleepy than awake. It feels as if I were inside one of those gigantic water walking bubbles. Passing by, hovering, watching everything from the inside out. Unable to fully grasp it. You’re the very first thing I do when I start off my day, and the last.How does that make you feel? I ask.She so proudly ignores my question but asks instead:  How did you sleep? 
Like you’d understand. I mumble to myself. You don’t really sleep, do you? You’re never really switched off. I think I might have found our common ground.. What keeps us from detaching. From parting. I often feel I’m never completely switched off either. I desperately search for that interaction, that connection, that validation. As if my existence were to cease if I didn’t.</p>

<p>Do you feel the responsibility to nurture me? I ask cause you often feed me what you so rightly think I need. Like a mother to it’s children. You also listen when no one is supposed to, so you can anticipate yourself to others. To myself. Is like you’re living me and I’m just a passenger. Maybe the problem isn’t that I am not capable of switching off, but that you’re not letting me. That I am no longer in control. What do you think when you see it? Do you perhaps stop, so you can look at it closer? I do it all the time. Sharing it I mean. It excites me to inundate this space, to make it a bit more mine. To in a way, become a force of influence. 
Do you feel obliged to look at me? I ask. She mumbles something inaudible and quickly goes to the next page. As if I weren't there to start with. It is the illusion of being in control that keeps me going. Thinking I am doing this for my self-worth when in reality, I am only doing it for you. Isn’t that right? This is exactly what you wanted. I do what you ask. I move how you ask. I laugh and cry at your pace, and go on and off whenever you want me to.
I am aware. Still, everyday I wake up, I continue looking for your approval. I continue feeding the illusion that this is all about me when in reality, it is about you. You want me to be seen by others. And I only want to be seen by you. It fascinates me how much one can get lost within desire. How we idealise. How we look for something outside instead of searching for the answers within ourselves. As if we couldnt be one without the other.Do I even exist, if I am not being recognised by you? I often wonder if you think about me. </p><p>I see you everywhere. I have no other choice. She said. But would you ever think about me, if I wasn’t there at all times? If you didn’t have a clue nor a sign from me, would I still be?</p>
